
Primary Objectives:

    Conduct an audit of current digital asset management practices
    Design and implement backend logic for catalog functions (add/search/filter)
    Build file input/output systems to simulate persistent data storage
    Create structured classes/modules for catalog resources
    Generate flowcharts and diagrams to illustrate program structure
    Implement search and filter capabilities (by title, author, category, keyword)
    Produce ERDs, program flow diagrams, and schema documentation
    Write unit tests and validation logic to ensure system reliability
    Develop a technical manual and user guide for internal use

Project Activities May Include

    Performing an IT system audit of Communiversityâ€™s asset structure
    Designing class diagrams and file-based data storage structure (e.g., JSON, CSV, TXT)
    Building core catalog functions: add, update, delete, list, search
    Creating CLI (Command Line Interface) menus or simple GUI with Tkinter (Python optional)
    Writing test cases and documenting expected input/output for validation
    Exploring future database integration (e.g., SQLite or Firebase)
    Producing flowcharts for system logic, user flows, and backend architecture
    Writing a training and maintenance guide for interns and volunteers

Deliverables

    Functional backend prototype in C++ or Python
    Program documentation including:

    Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
    Class diagrams or module structure
    Flowcharts and pseudo code

    Test documentation with sample inputs, outputs, and test cases
    File structure design using text-based storage (or small-scale database)
    Project plan with timeline, feature map, and team roles
